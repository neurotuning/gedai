Development
===========

gedai is maintained by `Victor Férat`_ and `Tomas Ros`_.

The project accepts contributions in the form of bug reports, fixes, feature
additions, and documentation improvements (including typo corrections).
The best way to start contributing is by `opening an issue <project issues_>`_
on our GitHub page to discuss ideas for changes or enhancements, or to tell us
about behavior that you think might be a bug.

A complete changelog can be found :ref:`here <changelog>`.

The project architecture is inspired by https://github.com/mscheltienne/template-python by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_.
